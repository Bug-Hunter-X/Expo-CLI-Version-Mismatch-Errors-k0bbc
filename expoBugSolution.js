The solution is to update the versions of your project dependencies in `package.json` to match the requirements of your current Expo CLI.  First, identify the incompatible packages and their recommended versions (often stated in Expo CLI release notes or the Expo documentation).  Then, update the versions in your `package.json` file. For example:

```json
{
  // ... other dependencies ...
  "expo": "^48.0.0",
  "react-native": "~0.71.0",
  // ... other dependencies ...
}
```

After making these changes, run `expo install` to install the updated packages. Then run `expo start` or rebuild your project. This should resolve most version mismatch errors.
